        <p><span class="first-character sc">P</span>RO is responsible for assigning referees to professional men’s and women’s leagues in the U.S. such as the MLS and NWLS. It is not associated with the ISRC.</p>
        
        <p class="margin-top-10"> 
    Through her position at PRO, Serafini has discovered that women in all states, not just Illinois, have difficulty being assigned quality games.
    
    <p>“If girls want to move up they may have to look to try to get the games they need in other states,” said Serafini. This is something few men have to do. 
    
    <p>Female referees face other obstacles as well when trying to advance in men’s soccer. The fitness tests male and female refs are must pass to advance take into account referees physical abilities. And in Illinois, according to Madison, the tests also consider how fit a referee appears.</p>
    
    <p>“[Assessors and assignors] want you to look a certain part. You have to look fit and trim and have to look presentable,” Madison said. </p>
    
    <p>Currently, referee uniforms are made for men. Women have to wear jerseys that are often baggy, making them look unfit. Female refs have their uniforms tailored so they fit tighter, but the ISRC doesn’t pay for the alterations.</p> 
    
    <p>“My daughter is an official and we have had to tailor all her shirts,” Chambers said. “The shirts aren’t tailored for women so we have to work with what we have.” 
    
    <p>Serafini, who is a former FIFA official, tailored her uniforms, but stated it was her choice. 
    
    <p>“Forty-five dollars for the shirt and another $45 to tailor it to fit me correctly,” said Serafini. “It’s the cost of business, but it’s not something that’s going to cost [girls] games.” 
    
    <p>That may not seem like much, but Madison pointed out that most refs have up to ten shirts, so the costs add up. Contrary to Serafini’s point of view, Madison said she thinks a woman not tailoring her shirts could be detrimental, especially in Illinois. 
    
    <p>“If a female has a big chest, the jersey will be baggy around her midsection and she might not get the games she needs,” said Madison, who also said female officials in Illinois are told to lose weight and to keep their makeup subtle. 
    
    <p>State Director of Assessments Elie Ghawi, the lone woman on the ISRC board of directors, declined to comment. Siomos denied that women officials are told to lose weight. 
    
    <p>“No, [they aren’t told to lose weight] because none of them are overweight,” said Siomos. “Well, maybe they are at the lower levels.” 
    
    <p>Female officials also face scrutiny from male coaches, players and officials.</p>
